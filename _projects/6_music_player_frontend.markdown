description: Ordered storage of artists and their albums using binary search trees and linked lists.
long_description: <h3>This is a storage system for artist names and their album titles. It has a graphical user interface. My intent in writing this program was to use data structures in an applied setting. Artist names are stored in a binary search tree (ordered alphabetically). Each node in the binary search tree contains a pointer to the head of a doubly linked list. It is in these lists that artists' albums are stored.</h3><h3>For more details, <a href="https://github.com/ZackBarry/MusicPlayer_Frontend" style="color:blue">see the repository.</a></h3>
