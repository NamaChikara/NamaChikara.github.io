As an Associate Data Scientist at [G5](getg5.com), my job is to provide internal and external stakeholders with insights they can't find elsewhere.  Sometimes I do this by leveraging [sparklyr](https://spark.rstudio.com/) to write production-ready models that crunch through terabytes of data. Other times I do this by building interactive [Shiny dashboards](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) that leverage years of data across thousands of clients. I always do this in collaboration with data scientists, data engineers, product managers, and sales leaders.

My current side project is to improve my working knowledge of ["Big Data"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6kSnM7WsAE6m9b.jpg) by learning Scala. sparklyr and PySpark are great libraries for collaboratively prototyping Spark models, but they can become [costly](https://www.dezyre.com/article/scala-vs-python-for-apache-spark/213) when there's a big job that needs to run every night. I will be documenting some of my learnings on this blog.

In my free time, I am always feeding my music and concert addiction.  I backpack when the ground is dry, skate ski when the ground is frozen, and disc golf whenever I can.
