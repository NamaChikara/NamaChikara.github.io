As an Associate Data Scientist at [G5](getg5.com), I mine user journeys for insights that power advertising and conversion funnel optimization.  I use Spark and Airflow to productionize models capable of crunching through terabytes of user data.  I also build interactive [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) dashboards to provide account managers and sales leaders with statistically-significant performance metrics.  

My current side project is to improve my working knowledge of MLOps by learning Docker and Kubernetes. Quora lists data pipelines as one of the [top inefficiencies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/04/07/what-are-the-largest-inefficiencies-in-a-data-scientists-workflow/#70196702a22f) in data science workflows.  I've worked with Airflow and GCP for ETL and deployment at work, so it's time to pick up something new.  I will be documenting some of my learnings on this blog; the codebase is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/ZackBarry/infinitePlaylists).

In my free time, I am always feeding my music and concert addiction.  I backpack when the ground is dry, skate ski when the ground is frozen, and disc golf whenever I can.  You can find some of my travel photos on my [projects page](https://zackbarry.github.io/projects/).
